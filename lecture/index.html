              focused, motivated, and committed to your goals. Don't hesitate to
              reach out to me or other campus resources when you need support.
              <br /><br />
              Keep in mind that this is a general guide, and you should tailor
              your counseling session to the individual student's needs and
              concerns. Good luck!
